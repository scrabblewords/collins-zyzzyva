Drag the Zyzzyva app into your /Applications folder. If you have an older
version of Zyzzyva installed, just select the option to replace it.

If you had a previous version of Zyzzyva, then your default lexicon will still
be CSW15. You'll have to change your default lexicon to CSW19 by editing the
"Load lexicons" option in preferences.
